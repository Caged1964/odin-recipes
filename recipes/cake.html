            <h5>Step-1</h5>
            <p>Prepare cake mix according to package directions, using required ingredients, plus pudding mix, vanilla,
                and
                an additional 1/4 cup of water. Spread batter evenly among three greased and floured 9 inch cake pans.
                Bake
                at temperature specified on cake mix box for 18 to 22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the
                center
                comes out clean. Let cakes cool completely, then chill in refrigerator for 30 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>Step-2</h5>
            <p>In a double boiler over simmering water, melt chocolate chips. Gradually add 1/4 cup of the whipping
                cream,
                stirring constantly until smooth. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature. Beat 3/4 cup of
                whipping cream until soft peaks form. Fold the whipped cream into the cooled chocolate mixture. Stir in
                1/2
                cup of the finely chopped hazelnuts. Chill 30 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>Step-3</h5>
            <p>Beat remaining 2 cups of whipping cream until soft peaks form, then fold in the remaining 1/2 cup of
                chopped
                hazelnuts. Chill until ready to frost cake.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h5>Step-4</h5>
            <p>Place 1 cake layer on cake plate. Spread 1/2 of the chilled chocolate mixture over top. Add another cake
                layer. Spread with other 1/2 of chocolate mixture. Top with last cake layer. Frost entire cake with
                hazelnut-whipped cream. Place 12 whole hazelnuts around top outer edge of cake as a garnish. This cake
                should be kept in the refrigerator.</p>
